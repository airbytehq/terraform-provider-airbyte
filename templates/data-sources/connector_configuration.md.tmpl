# {{.Name}} (Data Source)

Resolves and merges connector configuration for use with airbyte_source or airbyte_destination resources.

This data source resolves a connector name (and optional version) to its definition ID, fetches the
connector's JSONSchema spec, validates configuration against it, and merges non-sensitive and sensitive
configuration into a single JSON blob suitable for passing to a resource.

## Example Usage

### Pin to a specific connector version

Fetch the spec for an exact version and validate configuration against it:

```terraform
data "airbyte_connector_configuration" "github" {
  connector_name    = "source-github"
  connector_version = "2.0.0"

  configuration = {
    repositories = ["airbytehq/airbyte"]
    credentials = {
      option_title         = "PAT Credentials"
      personal_access_token = var.github_pat
    }
  }
}
```

### Use the latest version with separate secrets

When `connector_version` is omitted, the latest spec is fetched. Use `configuration_secrets` to keep sensitive values hidden in plan output:

```terraform
data "airbyte_connector_configuration" "postgres" {
  connector_name = "source-postgres"
  # connector_version = "3.6.28"  # optional: pin to a specific version

  configuration = {
    host     = "db.example.com"
    port     = 5432
    database = "mydb"
    schemas  = ["public"]
    ssl_mode = { mode = "prefer" }
  }

  configuration_secrets = {
    username = var.pg_user
    password = var.pg_password
  }
}
```

### Pass resolved values to a resource

Use the data source outputs to configure an [`airbyte_source`](../resources/source.md) or [`airbyte_destination`](../resources/destination.md) resource:

```terraform
resource "airbyte_source" "postgres" {
  name          = "Postgres"
  definition_id = data.airbyte_connector_configuration.postgres.definition_id
  workspace_id  = var.workspace_id
  configuration = data.airbyte_connector_configuration.postgres.configuration_json
}
```
