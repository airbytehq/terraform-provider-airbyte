# {{.Name}}

Manages an Airbyte source connector.

This is the **generic source resource** that works with any Airbyte source connector type. Pass the connector's `definition_id` and a JSON `configuration` blob. Use the [`airbyte_connector_configuration`](../data-sources/connector_configuration.md) data source to resolve connector names to definition IDs and to get clean Terraform diffs on non-sensitive values.

~> **Migrating from typed resources?** If you are upgrading from a pre-1.0 provider version or moving from a typed resource like `airbyte_source_postgres`, see the [Migrating to 1.0](../guides/v1_migration_guide.md) guide for step-by-step instructions using Terraform's `moved` block.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/airbyte_source/resource.tf"}}

## Migrating from typed resources

Typed source resources (`airbyte_source_postgres`, `airbyte_source_github`, etc.) are replaced by this generic `airbyte_source` resource in provider 1.0+. Use a [`moved` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/moved) (Terraform >= 1.8) for a zero-downtime migration:

```terraform
moved {
  from = airbyte_source_postgres.my_source
  to   = airbyte_source.my_source
}
```

For full details including alternative methods for older Terraform versions, see the [Migrating to 1.0](../guides/v1_migration_guide.md) guide.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{codefile "shell" "examples/resources/airbyte_source/import.sh"}}

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used:

{{tffile "examples/resources/airbyte_source/import-by-string-id.tf"}}
