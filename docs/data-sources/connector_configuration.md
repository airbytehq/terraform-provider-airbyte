# airbyte_connector_configuration (Data Source)

Resolves and merges connector configuration for use with airbyte_source or airbyte_destination resources.

This data source resolves a connector name (and optional version) to its definition ID, fetches the
connector's JSONSchema spec, validates configuration against it, and merges non-sensitive and sensitive
configuration into a single JSON blob suitable for passing to a resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Pin a source connector to a specific version and validate configuration
data "airbyte_connector_configuration" "github" {
  connector_name    = "source-github"
  connector_version = "2.0.0"

  configuration = {
    repositories = ["airbytehq/airbyte"]
    credentials = {
      option_title         = "PAT Credentials"
      personal_access_token = var.github_pat
    }
  }
}

# Use the latest version (default) with separate secrets
data "airbyte_connector_configuration" "postgres" {
  connector_name = "source-postgres"
  # connector_version = "3.6.28"  # optional: pin to a specific version

  configuration = {
    host     = "db.example.com"
    port     = 5432
    database = "mydb"
    schemas  = ["public"]
    ssl_mode = { mode = "prefer" }
  }

  configuration_secrets = {
    username = var.pg_user
    password = var.pg_password
  }
}

# Pass the resolved values to an airbyte_source resource
resource "airbyte_source" "postgres" {
  name            = "Postgres"
  definition_id   = data.airbyte_connector_configuration.postgres.definition_id
  workspace_id    = var.workspace_id
  configuration   = data.airbyte_connector_configuration.postgres.configuration_json
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `configuration` (Dynamic) Non-sensitive configuration values as an HCL object. These will be visible in Terraform plan output.
- `connector_name` (String) The name of the connector (e.g. `source-postgres`, `destination-bigquery`).

### Optional

- `configuration_secrets` (Dynamic, Sensitive) Sensitive configuration values (API keys, passwords, etc.) as an HCL object. These are hidden in Terraform plan output. Keys here are deep-merged with (and override) keys in `configuration`.
- `connector_version` (String) The version of the connector (e.g. `2.0.0`). If not specified, the latest version is used. When set, the connector spec for that exact version is fetched and used for JSONSchema validation.
- `ignore_errors` (Boolean) If true, validation errors (including JSONSchema validation) are reported as warnings instead of errors. Defaults to false.

### Read-Only

- `configuration_json` (String, Sensitive) The merged JSON configuration (non-sensitive + sensitive) for passing to an airbyte_source or airbyte_destination resource's `configuration` attribute.
- `connector_spec_json` (String) The connector's `connectionSpecification` JSONSchema, as a JSON string. Useful for debugging or downstream tooling.
- `definition_id` (String) The UUID of the connector definition, resolved from `connector_name`.
- `docker_image_tag` (String) The resolved Docker image tag (version) of the connector.
