# airbyte_connector_configuration (Data Source)

Resolves and merges connector configuration for use with airbyte_source or airbyte_destination resources.

This data source resolves a connector name to its definition ID and merges non-sensitive and sensitive
configuration into a single JSON blob suitable for passing to a resource.

Use this data source to get clean Terraform diffs on non-sensitive configuration values while keeping
secrets hidden in state and plan output.

## Schema

### Required

- `configuration` (Dynamic) Non-sensitive configuration values as an HCL object. These will be visible in Terraform plan output.
- `connector_name` (String) The name of the connector (e.g. `source-postgres`, `destination-bigquery`).

### Optional

- `configuration_secrets` (Dynamic, Sensitive) Sensitive configuration values (API keys, passwords, etc.) as an HCL object. These are hidden in Terraform plan output. Keys here are deep-merged with (and override) keys in `configuration`.
- `connector_version` (String) The version of the connector. If not specified, the latest version from the registry is used. Currently unused; reserved for future JSONSchema validation.
- `ignore_errors` (Boolean) If true, validation errors are reported as warnings instead of errors. Defaults to false.

### Read-Only

- `configuration_json` (String, Sensitive) The merged JSON configuration (non-sensitive + sensitive) for passing to an airbyte_source or airbyte_destination resource's `configuration` attribute.
- `definition_id` (String) The UUID of the connector definition, resolved from `connector_name`.
