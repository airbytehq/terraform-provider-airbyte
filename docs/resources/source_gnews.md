SourceGnews Resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "airbyte_source_gnews" "my_source_gnews" {
  configuration = {
    additional_properties = "{ \"see\": \"documentation\" }"
    api_key               = "...my_api_key..."
    country               = "gr"
    end_date              = "2022-08-21 16:27:09"

## Schema

### Required

- `configuration` (Attributes) The values required to configure the source. The schema for this must match the schema return by source_definition_specifications/get for the source. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration))
- `name` (String) Name of the source e.g. dev-mysql-instance.
- `workspace_id` (String)

### Optional

- `definition_id` (String) The UUID of the connector definition. One of configuration.sourceType or definitionId must be provided. Default: "ce38aec4-5a77-439a-be29-9ca44fd4e811"; Requires replacement if changed.
- `secret_id` (String) Optional secretID obtained through the public API OAuth redirect flow. Requires replacement if changed.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (Number)
- `resource_allocation` (Attributes) actor or actor definition specific resource requirements. if default is set, these are the requirements that should be set for ALL jobs run for this actor definition. it is overriden by the job type specific configurations. if not set, the platform will use defaults. these values will be overriden by configuration at the connection level. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--resource_allocation))
- `source_id` (String)
- `source_type` (String)

### Nested Schema for `configuration`

Required:

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) API Key
- `query` (String) This parameter allows you to specify your search keywords to find the news articles you are looking for. The keywords will be used to return the most relevant articles. It is possible to use logical operators  with keywords. - Phrase Search Operator: This operator allows you to make an exact search. Keywords surrounded by 
  quotation marks are used to search for articles with the exact same keyword
sequence. 
  For example the query: "Apple iPhone" will return articles matching at
least once this sequence of keywords. - Logical AND Operator: This operator allows you to make sure that several keywords are all used in the article
  search. By default the space character acts as an AND operator, it is
possible to replace the space character 
  by AND to obtain the same result. For example the query: Apple Microsoft
is equivalent to Apple AND Microsoft - Logical OR Operator: This operator allows you to retrieve articles matching the keyword a or the keyword b.
  It is important to note that this operator has a higher precedence than
the AND operator. For example the 
  query: Apple OR Microsoft will return all articles matching the keyword
Apple as well as all articles matching 
  the keyword Microsoft
- Logical NOT Operator: This operator allows you to remove from the results the articles corresponding to the
  specified keywords. To use it, you need to add NOT in front of each word
or phrase surrounded by quotes.
  For example the query: Apple NOT iPhone will return all articles matching
the keyword Apple but not the keyword
  iPhone

Optional:

- `additional_properties` (String) Parsed as JSON.
- `country` (String) This parameter allows you to specify the country where the news articles returned by the API were published, the contents of the articles are not necessarily related to the specified country. You have to set as value the 2 letters code of the country you want to filter. must be one of ["au", "br", "ca", "cn", "eg", "fr", "de", "gr", "hk", "in", "ie", "il", "it", "jp", "nl", "no", "pk", "pe", "ph", "pt", "ro", "ru", "sg", "es", "se", "ch", "tw", "ua", "gb", "us"]
- `end_date` (String) This parameter allows you to filter the articles that have a publication date smaller than or equal to the  specified value. The date must respect the following format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss (in UTC)
- `in` (List of String) This parameter allows you to choose in which attributes the keywords are searched. The attributes that can be set are title, description and content. It is possible to combine several attributes.
- `language` (String) must be one of ["ar", "zh", "nl", "en", "fr", "de", "el", "he", "hi", "it", "ja", "ml", "mr", "no", "pt", "ro", "ru", "es", "sv", "ta", "te", "uk"]
- `nullable` (List of String) This parameter allows you to specify the attributes that you allow to return null values. The attributes that  can be set are title, description and content. It is possible to combine several attributes
- `sortby` (String) This parameter allows you to choose with which type of sorting the articles should be returned. Two values  are possible:
  - publishedAt = sort by publication date, the articles with the most recent
publication date are returned first
  - relevance = sort by best match to keywords, the articles with the best
match are returned first
must be one of ["publishedAt", "relevance"]
- `start_date` (String) This parameter allows you to filter the articles that have a publication date greater than or equal to the  specified value. The date must respect the following format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss (in UTC)
- `top_headlines_query` (String) This parameter allows you to specify your search keywords to find the news articles you are looking for. The keywords will be used to return the most relevant articles. It is possible to use logical operators  with keywords. - Phrase Search Operator: This operator allows you to make an exact search. Keywords surrounded by 
  quotation marks are used to search for articles with the exact same keyword
sequence. 
  For example the query: "Apple iPhone" will return articles matching at

  iPhone
- `top_headlines_topic` (String) This parameter allows you to change the category for the request. must be one of ["breaking-news", "world", "nation", "business", "technology", "entertainment", "sports", "science", "health"]

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = airbyte_source_gnews.my_airbyte_source_gnews
  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import airbyte_source_gnews.my_airbyte_source_gnews "..."
```
