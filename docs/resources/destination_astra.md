## Schema

### Required

- `configuration` (Attributes) The configuration model for the Vector DB based destinations. This model is used to generate the UI for the destination configuration,
as well as to provide type safety for the configuration passed to the destination.

The configuration model is composed of four parts:
* Processing configuration
* Embedding configuration
* Indexing configuration
* Advanced configuration

Processing, embedding and advanced configuration are provided by this base class, while the indexing configuration is provided by the destination connector in the sub class. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration))
- `name` (String) Name of the destination e.g. dev-mysql-instance.
- `workspace_id` (String)

### Optional

- `definition_id` (String) The UUID of the connector definition. One of configuration.destinationType or definitionId must be provided. Requires replacement if changed.

### Read-Only

- `destination_id` (String)
- `destination_type` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration`

Required:

- `embedding` (Attributes) Embedding configuration (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--embedding))
- `indexing` (Attributes) Astra DB gives developers the APIs, real-time data and ecosystem integrations to put accurate RAG and Gen AI apps with fewer hallucinations in production. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--indexing))
- `processing` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--processing))

Optional:

- `omit_raw_text` (Boolean) Do not store the text that gets embedded along with the vector and the metadata in the destination. If set to true, only the vector and the metadata will be stored - in this case raw text for LLM use cases needs to be retrieved from another source. Default: false

<a id="nestedatt--configuration--embedding"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration.embedding`

Optional:

- `azure_open_ai` (Attributes) Use the Azure-hosted OpenAI API to embed text. This option is using the text-embedding-ada-002 model with 1536 embedding dimensions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--embedding--azure_open_ai))
- `cohere` (Attributes) Use the Cohere API to embed text. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--embedding--cohere))
- `fake` (Attributes) Use a fake embedding made out of random vectors with 1536 embedding dimensions. This is useful for testing the data pipeline without incurring any costs. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--embedding--fake))
- `open_ai` (Attributes) Use the OpenAI API to embed text. This option is using the text-embedding-ada-002 model with 1536 embedding dimensions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--embedding--open_ai))
- `open_ai_compatible` (Attributes) Use a service that's compatible with the OpenAI API to embed text. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--embedding--open_ai_compatible))

<a id="nestedatt--configuration--embedding--azure_open_ai"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration.embedding.azure_open_ai`

Required:

- `api_base` (String) The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource
- `deployment` (String) The deployment for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource
- `openai_key` (String, Sensitive) The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource


<a id="nestedatt--configuration--embedding--cohere"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration.embedding.cohere`

Required:

- `cohere_key` (String, Sensitive)


<a id="nestedatt--configuration--embedding--fake"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration.embedding.fake`


<a id="nestedatt--configuration--embedding--open_ai"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration.embedding.open_ai`

Required:

- `openai_key` (String, Sensitive)


<a id="nestedatt--configuration--embedding--open_ai_compatible"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration.embedding.open_ai_compatible`

Required:

- `base_url` (String) The base URL for your OpenAI-compatible service
- `dimensions` (Number) The number of dimensions the embedding model is generating

Optional:

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) Default: ""
- `model_name` (String) The name of the model to use for embedding. Default: "text-embedding-ada-002"



<a id="nestedatt--configuration--indexing"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration.indexing`

Required:

- `astra_db_app_token` (String, Sensitive) The application token authorizes a user to connect to a specific Astra DB database. It is created when the user clicks the Generate Token button on the Overview tab of the Database page in the Astra UI.
- `astra_db_endpoint` (String) The endpoint specifies which Astra DB database queries are sent to. It can be copied from the Database Details section of the Overview tab of the Database page in the Astra UI.
- `astra_db_keyspace` (String) Keyspaces (or Namespaces) serve as containers for organizing data within a database. You can create a new keyspace uisng the Data Explorer tab in the Astra UI. The keyspace default_keyspace is created for you when you create a Vector Database in Astra DB.
- `collection` (String) Collections hold data. They are analagous to tables in traditional Cassandra terminology. This tool will create the collection with the provided name automatically if it does not already exist. Alternatively, you can create one thorugh the Data Explorer tab in the Astra UI.


<a id="nestedatt--configuration--processing"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration.processing`

Required:

- `chunk_size` (Number) Size of chunks in tokens to store in vector store (make sure it is not too big for the context if your LLM)

Optional:

- `chunk_overlap` (Number) Size of overlap between chunks in tokens to store in vector store to better capture relevant context. Default: 0
- `field_name_mappings` (Attributes List) List of fields to rename. Not applicable for nested fields, but can be used to rename fields already flattened via dot notation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--processing--field_name_mappings))
- `metadata_fields` (List of String) List of fields in the record that should be stored as metadata. The field list is applied to all streams in the same way and non-existing fields are ignored. If none are defined, all fields are considered metadata fields. When specifying text fields, you can access nested fields in the record by using dot notation, e.g. `user.name` will access the `name` field in the `user` object. It's also possible to use wildcards to access all fields in an object, e.g. `users.*.name` will access all `names` fields in all entries of the `users` array. When specifying nested paths, all matching values are flattened into an array set to a field named by the path.
- `text_fields` (List of String) List of fields in the record that should be used to calculate the embedding. The field list is applied to all streams in the same way and non-existing fields are ignored. If none are defined, all fields are considered text fields. When specifying text fields, you can access nested fields in the record by using dot notation, e.g. `user.name` will access the `name` field in the `user` object. It's also possible to use wildcards to access all fields in an object, e.g. `users.*.name` will access all `names` fields in all entries of the `users` array.
- `text_splitter` (Attributes) Split text fields into chunks based on the specified method. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--processing--text_splitter))

- `by_programming_language` (Attributes) Split the text by suitable delimiters based on the programming language. This is useful for splitting code into chunks. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--processing--text_splitter--by_programming_language))
- `by_separator` (Attributes) Split the text by the list of separators until the chunk size is reached, using the earlier mentioned separators where possible. This is useful for splitting text fields by paragraphs, sentences, words, etc. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--processing--text_splitter--by_separator))

<a id="nestedatt--configuration--processing--text_splitter--by_markdown_header"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration.processing.text_splitter.by_separator`

- `keep_separator` (Boolean) Whether to keep the separator in the resulting chunks. Default: false
