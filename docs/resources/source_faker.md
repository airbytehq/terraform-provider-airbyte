```terraform
resource "airbyte_source_faker" "my_source_faker" {
  configuration = {
    count             = 8
    parallelism       = 4
    records_per_slice = 1
    records_per_sync  = 4
    seed              = 4
    source_type       = "faker"
  }
  name         = "Beth McKenzie"

## Schema

### Required

- `configuration` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration))
- `name` (String)
- `workspace_id` (String)

### Optional

- `secret_id` (String) Optional secretID obtained through the public API OAuth redirect flow.

### Read-Only

- `source_id` (String)
- `source_type` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration`

Required:

- `count` (Number) How many users should be generated in total.  This setting does not apply to the purchases or products stream.
- `source_type` (String) must be one of ["faker"]

Optional:

- `parallelism` (Number) How many parallel workers should we use to generate fake data?  Choose a value equal to the number of CPUs you will allocate to this source.
- `records_per_slice` (Number) How many fake records will be in each page (stream slice), before a state message is emitted?
- `records_per_sync` (Number) How many fake records will be returned for each sync, for each stream?  By default, it will take 2 syncs to create the requested 1000 records.
- `seed` (Number) Manually control the faker random seed to return the same values on subsequent runs (leave -1 for random)
