### Nested Schema for `configuration`

Required:

- `dataset_id` (String) The default BigQuery Dataset ID that tables are replicated to if the source does not specify a namespace. Read more <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets#create-dataset">here</a>.
- `dataset_location` (String) The location of the dataset. Warning: Changes made after creation will not be applied. Read more <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations">here</a>. must be one of ["US", "EU", "asia-east1", "asia-east2", "asia-northeast1", "asia-northeast2", "asia-northeast3", "asia-south1", "asia-south2", "asia-southeast1", "asia-southeast2", "australia-southeast1", "australia-southeast2", "europe-central1", "europe-central2", "europe-north1", "europe-southwest1", "europe-west1", "europe-west2", "europe-west3", "europe-west4", "europe-west6", "europe-west7", "europe-west8", "europe-west9", "europe-west12", "me-central1", "me-central2", "me-west1", "northamerica-northeast1", "northamerica-northeast2", "southamerica-east1", "southamerica-west1", "us-central1", "us-east1", "us-east2", "us-east3", "us-east4", "us-east5", "us-south1", "us-west1", "us-west2", "us-west3", "us-west4"]
- `project_id` (String) The GCP project ID for the project containing the target BigQuery dataset. Read more <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects">here</a>.

Optional:

- `big_query_client_buffer_size_mb` (Number) Google BigQuery client's chunk (buffer) size (MIN=1, MAX = 15) for each table. The size that will be written by a single RPC. Written data will be buffered and only flushed upon reaching this size or closing the channel. The default 15MB value is used if not set explicitly. Read more <a href="https://googleapis.dev/python/bigquery/latest/generated/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.html">here</a>. Default: 15
- `credentials_json` (String, Sensitive) The contents of the JSON service account key. Check out the <a href="https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/bigquery#service-account-key">docs</a> if you need help generating this key. Default credentials will be used if this field is left empty.
- `disable_type_dedupe` (Boolean) Disable Writing Final Tables. WARNING! The data format in _airbyte_data is likely stable but there are no guarantees that other metadata columns will remain the same in future versions. Default: false
- `loading_method` (Attributes) The way data will be uploaded to BigQuery. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--loading_method))
- `raw_data_dataset` (String) The dataset to write raw tables into (default: airbyte_internal)
- `transformation_priority` (String) Interactive run type means that the query is executed as soon as possible, and these queries count towards concurrent rate limit and daily limit. Read more about interactive run type <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries">here</a>. Batch queries are queued and started as soon as idle resources are available in the BigQuery shared resource pool, which usually occurs within a few minutes. Batch queries donâ€™t count towards your concurrent rate limit. Read more about batch queries <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries#batch">here</a>. The default "interactive" value is used if not set explicitly. must be one of ["interactive", "batch"]; Default: "interactive"

### Nested Schema for `configuration.loading_method`

Optional:

- `batched_standard_inserts` (Attributes) Direct loading using batched SQL INSERT statements. This method uses the BigQuery driver to convert large INSERT statements into file uploads automatically. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--loading_method--batched_standard_inserts))
- `gcs_staging` (Attributes) Writes large batches of records to a file, uploads the file to GCS, then uses COPY INTO to load your data into BigQuery. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--loading_method--gcs_staging))

- `gcs_bucket_path` (String) Directory under the GCS bucket where data will be written.

Optional:

- `keep_files_in_gcs_bucket` (String) This upload method is supposed to temporary store records in GCS bucket.

The default "Delete all tmp files from GCS" value is used if not set explicitly. must be one of ["Delete all tmp files from GCS", "Keep all tmp files in GCS"]; Default: "Delete all tmp files from GCS"
