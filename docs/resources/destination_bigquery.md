DestinationBigquery Resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "airbyte_destination_bigquery" "my_destination_bigquery" {
  configuration = {
    big_query_client_buffer_size_mb = 15

## Schema

### Required

- `configuration` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration))
- `name` (String)
- `workspace_id` (String)

### Read-Only

- `destination_id` (String)
- `destination_type` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration`

Required:

- `dataset_id` (String) The default BigQuery Dataset ID that tables are replicated to if the source does not specify a namespace. Read more <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets#create-dataset">here</a>.
- `dataset_location` (String) must be one of ["US", "EU", "asia-east1", "asia-east2", "asia-northeast1", "asia-northeast2", "asia-northeast3", "asia-south1", "asia-south2", "asia-southeast1", "asia-southeast2", "australia-southeast1", "australia-southeast2", "europe-central1", "europe-central2", "europe-north1", "europe-southwest1", "europe-west1", "europe-west2", "europe-west3", "europe-west4", "europe-west6", "europe-west7", "europe-west8", "europe-west9", "me-west1", "northamerica-northeast1", "northamerica-northeast2", "southamerica-east1", "southamerica-west1", "us-central1", "us-east1", "us-east2", "us-east3", "us-east4", "us-east5", "us-west1", "us-west2", "us-west3", "us-west4"]
The location of the dataset. Warning: Changes made after creation will not be applied. Read more <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations">here</a>.
- `destination_type` (String) must be one of ["bigquery"]
- `project_id` (String) The GCP project ID for the project containing the target BigQuery dataset. Read more <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects">here</a>.

Optional:

- `big_query_client_buffer_size_mb` (Number) Google BigQuery client's chunk (buffer) size (MIN=1, MAX = 15) for each table. The size that will be written by a single RPC. Written data will be buffered and only flushed upon reaching this size or closing the channel. The default 15MB value is used if not set explicitly. Read more <a href="https://googleapis.dev/python/bigquery/latest/generated/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.html">here</a>.
- `credentials_json` (String) The contents of the JSON service account key. Check out the <a href="https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/bigquery#service-account-key">docs</a> if you need help generating this key. Default credentials will be used if this field is left empty.
- `loading_method` (Attributes) Loading method used to send select the way data will be uploaded to BigQuery. <br/><b>Standard Inserts</b> - Direct uploading using SQL INSERT statements. This method is extremely inefficient and provided only for quick testing. In almost all cases, you should use staging. <br/><b>GCS Staging</b> - Writes large batches of records to a file, uploads the file to GCS, then uses <b>COPY INTO table</b> to upload the file. Recommended for most workloads for better speed and scalability. Read more about GCS Staging <a href="https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/bigquery#gcs-staging">here</a>. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--loading_method))
- `raw_data_dataset` (String) (Early Access) The dataset to write raw tables into
- `transformation_priority` (String) must be one of ["interactive", "batch"]
Interactive run type means that the query is executed as soon as possible, and these queries count towards concurrent rate limit and daily limit. Read more about interactive run type <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries">here</a>. Batch queries are queued and started as soon as idle resources are available in the BigQuery shared resource pool, which usually occurs within a few minutes. Batch queries donâ€™t count towards your concurrent rate limit. Read more about batch queries <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries#batch">here</a>. The default "interactive" value is used if not set explicitly.
- `use_1s1t_format` (Boolean) (Early Access) Use <a href="https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/typing-deduping" target="_blank">Destinations V2</a>.
