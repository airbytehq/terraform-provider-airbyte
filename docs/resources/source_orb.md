## Schema

### Required

- `configuration` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration))
- `name` (String) Name of the source e.g. dev-mysql-instance.
- `workspace_id` (String)

### Optional

- `definition_id` (String) The UUID of the connector definition. One of configuration.sourceType or definitionId must be provided. Requires replacement if changed.
- `secret_id` (String) Optional secretID obtained through the public API OAuth redirect flow. Requires replacement if changed.

### Read-Only

- `source_id` (String)
- `source_type` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `configuration`

Required:

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) Orb API Key, issued from the Orb admin console.
- `start_date` (String) UTC date and time in the format 2022-03-01T00:00:00Z. Any data with created_at before this data will not be synced. For Subscription Usage, this becomes the `timeframe_start` API parameter.

Optional:

- `end_date` (String) UTC date and time in the format 2022-03-01T00:00:00Z. Any data with created_at after this data will not be synced. For Subscription Usage, this becomes the `timeframe_start` API parameter.
- `lookback_window_days` (Number) When set to N, the connector will always refresh resources created within the past N days. By default, updated objects that are not newly created are not incrementally synced. Default: 0
- `numeric_event_properties_keys` (List of String, Sensitive) Property key names to extract from all events, in order to enrich ledger entries corresponding to an event deduction.
- `plan_id` (String) Orb Plan ID to filter subscriptions that should have usage fetched.
- `string_event_properties_keys` (List of String, Sensitive) Property key names to extract from all events, in order to enrich ledger entries corresponding to an event deduction.
- `subscription_usage_grouping_key` (String, Sensitive) Property key name to group subscription usage by.
