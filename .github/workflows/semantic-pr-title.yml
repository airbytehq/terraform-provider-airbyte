# Semantic PR Title Validation
#
# This workflow validates that PR titles follow the Conventional Commits format.
# This is required for the semantic-pr-release-drafter to correctly categorize changes.
#
# Valid formats:
# - feat: Add new feature
# - fix: Fix a bug
# - chore: Maintenance task
# - docs: Documentation changes
# - ci: CI/CD changes
# - refactor: Code refactoring
# - test: Test changes
# - perf: Performance improvements
# - feat!: Breaking change (major version bump)
#
# Optional scope: feat(api): Add new endpoint
