# Release Drafter Workflow
#
# This workflow automatically creates and updates draft releases based on merged PRs.
# It uses semantic PR titles (conventional commits format) to categorize changes.
#
# How it works:
# - On push to main: Updates the draft release with the merged PR and pre-built assets
# - Categories are determined by conventional commit type (feat, fix, chore, etc.)
#
# To publish a release:
# 1. Go to the Releases page
# 2. Find the draft release (assets are already attached!)
# 3. Edit the version number if needed
# 4. Click "Publish release" - this creates the git tag and triggers the Release workflow
#
# Note: This workflow builds and attaches assets to the draft release to prevent
# checksum mismatches with the Terraform Registry. The Registry syncs checksums
# when a release is published, so assets must be present at that time.
