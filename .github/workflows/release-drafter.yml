# Release Drafter Workflow
#
# This workflow automatically creates and updates draft releases based on merged PRs.
# It also auto-labels PRs based on conventional commit title patterns (e.g., "feat:", "fix:", "chore:").
#
# How it works:
# - On push to main: Updates the draft release with the merged PR
# - On PR open/update: Auto-labels the PR based on its title
#
# To publish a release:
# 1. Go to the Releases page
# 2. Find the draft release
# 3. Edit the version number if needed
# 4. Click "Publish release" - this creates the git tag and triggers the Release workflow
