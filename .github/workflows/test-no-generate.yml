# Terraform Provider Testing Workflow
#
# This workflow runs build, lint, and acceptance tests for the Terraform provider.
# It runs automatically on every pull request and push.
#
# Jobs:
# - build: Compiles the provider and runs golangci-lint
# - verify-docs-drift: Checks that generated docs (from `go generate`) are up to date
# - test: Runs Terraform acceptance tests against multiple Terraform versions
#
# Note: This workflow does NOT run Speakeasy generation. For Speakeasy regeneration
# of the provider code, use the manual "Generate" workflow (generate-command.yml).
#
# Note: Acceptance tests require TF_ACC=1 and may need additional credentials
# for testing against a real Airbyte instance.
