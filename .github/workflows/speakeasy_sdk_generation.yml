# Speakeasy SDK Generation Workflow
#
# This workflow regenerates the Terraform provider code from the upstream OpenAPI spec using Speakeasy.
# It creates a PR with the regenerated code for review.
#
# How to use:
# - Go to Actions > Generate > Run workflow
# - Select the branch to run on (usually main)
# - Optionally check "Force generation" to regenerate even if no changes detected
#
# For clean regeneration (when API spec has breaking changes):
# 1. First run the "Clean PR Branch" workflow on an existing Speakeasy PR branch
# 2. Then re-run this Generate workflow on main with force=true
