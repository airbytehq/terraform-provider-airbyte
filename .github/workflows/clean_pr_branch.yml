# Clean PR Branch Workflow
#
# This workflow deletes all generated files from an existing PR branch.
# Use this when the upstream API spec has breaking changes that require
# a fully clean regeneration.
#
# How to use:
# 1. Run the "Generate" workflow on main - this creates a Speakeasy PR
# 2. If regeneration fails due to stale files, run this workflow on the PR's branch
# 3. Re-run the "Generate" workflow on main with force=true
#
# The workflow will:
# - Delete all generated SDK code (internal/sdk)
# - Delete all generated provider resources (destination_*.go, source_*.go)
# - Delete all generated provider types (internal/provider/types/)
# - Commit and push the deletion to the branch
