# Terraform Provider Release Workflow (Manual Only)
#
# NOTE: This workflow is now only for emergency/manual releases.
# Normal releases are handled by the release-drafter workflow, which:
# 1. Builds assets on every push to main
# 2. Attaches them to the draft release
# 3. When you publish the draft, assets are already present
#
# This workflow is kept for manual releases only (e.g., rebuilding a release,
# creating a release from a specific commit, or emergency hotfixes).
#
# How to trigger:
# 1. Go to Actions > "Publish to Terraform Public Registry"
# 2. Click "Run workflow" and select the branch/tag
#
# Required secrets:
# - TERRAFORM_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY: GPG private key for signing
# - TERRAFORM_GPG_PASSPHRASE: Passphrase for the GPG key

name: Publish to Terraform Public Registry

# Only manual trigger - normal releases use pre-built assets from release-drafter
