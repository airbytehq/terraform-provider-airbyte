# Terraform Provider Release Workflow
#
# This workflow builds and publishes the Terraform provider to the Terraform Registry.
# It uses GoReleaser to build binaries for all platforms and sign them with GPG.
#
# How to trigger:
# 1. Go to Releases page and find the draft release created by release-drafter
# 2. Edit the version number if needed and click "Publish release"
# 3. This creates a git tag (e.g., v0.14.0) which triggers this workflow
#
# Alternatively, push a tag manually: git tag v0.14.0 && git push origin v0.14.0
#
# Required secrets:
# - TERRAFORM_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY: GPG private key for signing
# - TERRAFORM_GPG_PASSPHRASE: Passphrase for the GPG key
