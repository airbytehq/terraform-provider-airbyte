Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect

The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI
configuration:
 - airbytehq/airbyte in /Users/c.ogribin/tf-providers/airbyte-local

The behavior may therefore not match any released version of the provider and
applying changes may cause the state to become incompatible with published
releases.
airbyte_declarative_source_definition.exchange_rates: Refreshing state... [id=f8473b16-44bd-415e-b63a-37a730e617de]
airbyte_destination_dev_null.my_destination_devnull: Refreshing state... [name=dev-null-terraform]
airbyte_source_custom.my_exchange_rates: Refreshing state... [name=exchange rates]
airbyte_connection.tf_custom_declarative_definition_example: Refreshing state... [name=tf_custom_declarative_definition_example]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # airbyte_source_custom.my_exchange_rates will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "airbyte_source_custom" "my_exchange_rates" {
      ~ configuration = jsonencode(
          ~ {
              ~ api_key    = "**********" -> "Bli8LtpYKu07NVlB9QQavwSLbCbLLLhn"
                # (2 unchanged attributes hidden)
            }
        )
        name          = "exchange rates"
        # (4 unchanged attributes hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
