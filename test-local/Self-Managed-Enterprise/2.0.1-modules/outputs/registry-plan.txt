Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.destination_dev_null.airbyte_destination_custom.destination-dev-null will be created
  + resource "airbyte_destination_custom" "destination-dev-null" {
      + configuration       = jsonencode({})
      + created_at          = (known after apply)
      + definition_id       = "a7bcc9d8-13b3-4e49-b80d-d020b90045e3"
      + destination_id      = (known after apply)
      + destination_type    = (known after apply)
      + name                = "dev-null-terraform-module"
      + resource_allocation = (known after apply)
      + workspace_id        = "2e09f34d-a47c-44ff-84c3-ba67e3b3b13c"
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + destination_id = (known after apply)
  + workspace_name = "Terraform-test"

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
